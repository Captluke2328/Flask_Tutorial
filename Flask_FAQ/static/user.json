There is no model or device for these diodes – the only support we have are the layouts in the OECA evaluation chip.\n\nFor LVS, could try the following suggestion by the runset developer, though I have not tested it myself.\nPlace the DIODEF layer around the structures. Then place the recognized devices in a schematic view. Suggest to use virtual connect of all substrate contacts during the LVS run to avoid the multiple stamp connection error. Some structures of the layout are defined only as parasitic diodes. That means this structures are ignored during the LVS comparison. In the extracted netlist are all structures available.\n "
